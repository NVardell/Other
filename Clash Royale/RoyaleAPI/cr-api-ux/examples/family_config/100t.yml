    **100 Thieves** is an esports team competing in the North American region of Clash Royale League.
    The eight trophy-pushing clans below comprise the ladder branch of the organization.
    The clans are home to many experienced tournament players, including three participants in the Crown Duel.
    The clans were created as a result of a merger and re-branding of the Reddit Alpha Clan Family,
    founded by Woody in January 2016.
