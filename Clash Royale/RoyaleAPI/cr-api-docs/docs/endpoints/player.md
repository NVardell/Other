# Player(s)

This endpoint retrieves one or more player profiles, with basic stats and card collection.

!> Previously, the `/player` endpoint also returns battles and chest cycle. This is no longer the case. Please use the [Player Battles](endpoints/player_battles) and [Player Chests](endpoints/player_chests) endpoints to access them. This counts as 3 separate requests.
