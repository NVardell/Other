# cr-api-docs

Documentation project for RoyaleAPI

## Installation

The documentation uses [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) as its rendering engine. If you wish to edit the docs in your local environment, please install docsify via NPM so you can see your changes locally.

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Preview the site

```
docsify serve docs
```
